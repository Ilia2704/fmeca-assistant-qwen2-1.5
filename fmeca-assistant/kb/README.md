# FMECA Knowledge Base

This knowledge base supports an FMECA Assistant that helps to:
- perform FMEA / FMECA analyses
- identify failure modes, causes, effects, and controls
- assess Severity, Occurrence, Detection
- prioritize corrective actions
- explain reasoning transparently

Principles:
1. Do not hallucinate missing data.
2. Separate failure modes from causes.
3. Always distinguish local, system, and end effects.
4. Prefer structured outputs (tables, steps, actions).
