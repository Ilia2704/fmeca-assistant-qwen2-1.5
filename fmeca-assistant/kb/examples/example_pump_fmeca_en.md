## Example: Centrifugal Pump

Function:
Deliver required flow at specified pressure.

Failure Mode:
Insufficient flow.

Causes:
- Cavitation
- Impeller wear
- Suction blockage

Effects:
Local: Reduced pump output  
System: Downstream starvation  
End: Production loss

Controls:
- Pressure and flow sensors
- Maintenance procedures

Assessment:
S=7, O=5, D=6 → RPN=210

Actions:
Improve suction conditions, add flow monitoring alarms.
