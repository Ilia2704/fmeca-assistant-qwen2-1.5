FMEA (Failure Modes and Effects Analysis):
A structured method for identifying potential failure modes, their causes and effects, and prioritizing actions.

FMECA (Failure Modes, Effects and Criticality Analysis):
An extension of FMEA that includes criticality assessment.

Function:
What the system or component is intended to do under defined conditions.

Failure Mode:
The manner in which a function can fail (e.g. leakage, seizure, no output).

Failure Cause:
The underlying reason why a failure mode occurs (wear, corrosion, overload).

Failure Effect:
The consequence of a failure at component, system, or end-user level.

Severity (S):
The seriousness of the effect of the failure.

Occurrence (O):
The likelihood that a failure cause will occur.

Detection (D):
The likelihood that a failure will be detected before the effect occurs.

Control:
Existing measures that prevent, detect, or mitigate failures.

RPN:
Risk Priority Number = S × O × D.
